# Youverify Liveness Web Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate the `youverify-liveness-web` package into a web application and use Parcel for bundling and development.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) 
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

## Development
Start the Development Server

Use Parcel to serve your application:

  ```bash
Yarn install 
npx parcel index.html
  ```

Parcel will start a development server and open the application in your default browser. The server will automatically reload when you make changes to your files. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:1234 to see the application in action.
